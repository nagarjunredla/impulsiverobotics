The problem was that I tried adding to the complexity by taking too many variables into account.

I will revisit these issues in a build I’ve been working on for a while, but wanted to mention this to explain why this isn’t under the “builds” category. The Redbot Extreme was almost okay but it wasn’t Akerman.</p><p>Learning from earlier mistakes, I wasn’t going to make another one by trying to build a RC car with Ackerman steering from the ground up. I remember watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOj53RRgtmg">a video by Hackaday</a> where they mentioned the Donkeycar, so I thought I’d give it a try.</p><p>The build is very straightforward, but sourcing the base is not. This build was going to be as hassle free as possible to I sourced whatever <a href=https://squareup.com/store/donkeycar>donkeycar sold</a> on their site but couldn’t find the recommended RC car in stock. Newegg let me order one but the supplier immediately cancelled the order. So I went for the Exceed Desert Monster build, which offers its own set of advantages.</p><p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEWle07yx-cZZR9Hzo2MQCzz5jEA2K5C7j7gnUvUsZ6bv91AuqQ97H0WENBXze7bD6iDe_c_18K5U3k8tnnLptkEtGh_VinbRb9sjpjOJ_EnCleh13LOv03mEMLyLAd9Z2-4Cox_tQn6Ycld4Qt0icTaJA=w1056-h1408-no" alt="Battery Comparison"><figcaption>The recommended LiPo battery is almost as big as the NiMH battery the RC car comes with</figcaption></figure></p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2022 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
