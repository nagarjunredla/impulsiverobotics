The problem was that I tried adding to the complexity by taking too many variables into account. I tried multiple differential drive kits only to realize some tiny part about it wouldn’t make it feasible to use. I will revisit these issues in a build I’ve been working on for a while, but wanted to mention this to explain why this isn’t under the “builds” category. The Redbot Extreme was almost okay but it wasn’t Akerman.</p><p>Learning from earlier mistakes, I wasn’t going to make another one by trying to build a RC car with Ackerman steering from the ground up. I remember watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOj53RRgtmg">a video by Hackaday</a> where they mentioned the Donkeycar, so I thought I’d give it a try.</p><p>The build is very straightforward, but sourcing the base is not. This build was going to be as hassle free as possible to I sourced whatever <a href=https://squareup.com/store/donkeycar>donkeycar sold</a> on their site but couldn’t find the recommended RC car in stock. Newegg let me order one but the supplier immediately cancelled the order. So I went for the Exceed Desert Monster build, which offers its own set of advantages.</p><p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PMeWW_MHhFWXw67wQtGpBtn3z6VXUCTvR6jTF6QpPvJySm0qoebLWaORQNSuL8RvWFdlIr9PZNgseqBL1qsFF90T9nCVlCz6CRMxSR2GuLQf7OGFYj8fvcAlWuCMqc72WyJXpN_oBUc=w600" alt="Battery size comparison"><figcaption>The recommended LiPo battery is almost as big as the NiMH battery the RC car comes with</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qiImVGPlCUnbS_gmoBqvEriGmz4ZnTVyf4SXz17k0ujtvolCF8Z_WF1x5CKweS0ADYWMB4TGq2jDTHDUsruV1c_uwTQju8EaLRGMZzS6R73zD1SSjRnxI0iADbEu17oil9mmq1_z89g=w600" alt="LiPo battery assembly"><figcaption>Butt first without squishing the axle’s gear.
