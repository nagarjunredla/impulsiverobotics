I’ve been interested in building a self-navigating robot for a while from hobby electronics. The problem was that I tried adding to the complexity by taking too many variables into account. I tried multiple differential drive kits only to realize some tiny part about it wouldn’t make it feasible to use. I will revisit these issues in a build I’ve been working on for a while, but wanted to mention this to explain why this isn’t under the “builds” category. The Redbot Extreme was almost okay but it wasn’t Akerman.

Learning from earlier mistakes, I wasn’t going to make another one by trying to build a RC car with Ackerman steering from the ground up. I remember watching [a video by Hackaday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOj53RRgtmg) where they mentioned the Donkeycar, so I thought I’d give it a try.

The build is very straightforward, but sourcing the base is not. This build was going to be as hassle free as possible to I sourced whatever [donkeycar sold](https://squareup.com/store/donkeycar) on their site but couldn’t find the recommended RC car in stock. Newegg let me order one but the supplier immediately cancelled the order. So I went for the Exceed Desert Monster build, which offers its own set of advantages.
