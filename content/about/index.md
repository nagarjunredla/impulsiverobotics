Hi! I’m a graduate student who likes to tinker with electronics! I usually build robots to better understand the courses I take. Building robots to supplement college courses usually need elaborate planning and might be expensive, but guess what?

So I usually build them with hardware I have lying around, which ends up with varied results. Every time I build something that might not work, I always wish there was someone out there who can tell me how NOT to do it.

So I thought I’d document my experiences for all you guys who are reading this with a soldering iron in their hand, ready to build something that you know might not work.
